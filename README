Mixpanelcpp library

This is a barebones Mixpanel library for C++. It is currently only able
to track normal mixpanel events and is not setup for Mixpanel People.

The library has two dependencies: libcurl and jsoncpp, which are provided in
their respective subdirectories.

This library has been tested in Windows and OSX, and Visual Studio / Xcode
projects are provided. For OSX, the Running from Xcode should be enough
to build the project. For Windows, you first need to build jsoncpp (you can use
the provided build_jsoncpp.bat script).

Example usage can be found in the mixpanelcppexample subdirectory.
